# üí∏ TipCalculator ‚Äì Simple Python Bill Splitter with Tip

**TipCalculator** is a beginner-friendly **Python project** that calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a tip. Built as part of **Angela Yu‚Äôs 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**, this script is perfect for learning input handling, arithmetic, and formatted output.

## üöÄ What This Project Does

This Python CLI tool:
- Asks for the **total bill amount**
- Lets the user choose a **tip percentage** (e.g. 10%, 12%, 15%)
- Divides the total (bill + tip) by the **number of people**
- Outputs how much **each person should pay**, rounded to two decimal places

## üß† What You‚Äôll Learn

This project helps you practice:
- `input()`, `float()`, and `int()` for user input and type conversion
- Arithmetic operations and percentage math
- Using `round()` for formatting results
- Python `f-strings` for clean output
